Instructions for running the ASR system on Linux

You need the following files:

Loginned.py  (main ASR code)
get_proper_names.py   (gets the unusual names from a book)
Initial Test-7a18acb3c794.json  (the google speech API authentication info)
runASR.sh   (script to sort out authenication and call everything else)
google-10000-english.txt   (a list of the most common English words)
A book - the following are included here:
    War and Peace
    The Tennant of Wildfell Hall
    Great Expectations
    Dream of the Red Chamber

To run it, make sure everything is in the same folder, then run runASR.sh in the command line. It will write the output to a json file "data_file.json" in the same folder.

The system will only record questions that are within 20 seconds of its keyword, currently "Kylie".
